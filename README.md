# 🕵️‍♀️ Investigative Crime Analytics: Violent Crime Detection & Pattern Analysis in Chicago

This project simulates real-world crime analytics using the **Chicago Crime Dataset (2001–Present)**. It focuses on identifying **violent crime incidents**, uncovering **temporal anomalies**, mapping **location-based trends**, and generating **NLP-driven incident summaries** — all critical components in building investigative intelligence and improving public safety strategies.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Law enforcement agencies deal with massive volumes of crime incident data. However, making sense of this data to detect **violent threats**, **spikes in criminal activity**, or **emerging geographic hotspots** remains challenging without automated tools.

This project aims to answer:

> **"Where, when, and how are violent crimes occurring across Chicago — and how can we extract actionable insights from free-text incident descriptions?"**

---

## ✅ Goals

1. 🔍 **Classify violent vs. non-violent crimes** using structured and unstructured data
2. 📈 **Detect anomalies** in crime frequency across time (e.g., unexpected spikes)
3. 🌍 **Map relationships** between crime types and locations via link analysis
4. 🧠 **Summarize incident narratives** using LLMs to simulate investigative profiling

---

## 📊 Key Metrics

- **Classification Accuracy**: How well violent incidents are detected (Precision, Recall, F1)
- **Anomaly Score**: Time-series deviations (z-score, IQR, moving average deltas)
- **Top Co-occurring Crime-Location Pairs**: Using graph centrality and clusters
- **LLM Summary Quality**: Qualitative evaluation of GPT summaries (optional)
